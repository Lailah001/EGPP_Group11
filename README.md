Unreal Engine - Topic: Enhance Virtual Reality by creating a new headset that implements GPS and an alert system. 

Grand Challenge Topic:
  Enhance Virtual Reality	
  
Problem:
  User cannot see their surroundings when using the VR headset							

Solution:
  Create a new headset that implements GPS and an alert system							

Solution Explanation/Example:
  We can enhance virtual reality by solving the issue of there being a lack off being able to see your surroundings when using a VR headset. We could add motion sensors and gps to the headsets that would allow the user to freely move while using the vr system. Similar to the idea of a car that beeps when your are in reverse if you are near an item it could alert the user that there are near an item - we could have a warning symbol and voice display to the user. Also similar to the idea of the car gps that tells you when to turn right and left, we could do the same with the headsets adding arrows on the right or left and a voice telling the user right or left (or slight turn, etc). An example of a time where a user may want to be able to freely move while using the VR headset may be if they were doing personal shopping. Lets say a customer at home was able to use vr to shop for what items they wanted in a store by being able to see a virtual version of the store. Then the personal shopper, our user, would be able to use their own vr headset, the one we invented, when they go into the store that would have some sort of symbol at the areas in the store that the customer wants them to go to to pick up the items. Using our headset, they would be able to successfully pick up all of the items without bumbing into anything.
